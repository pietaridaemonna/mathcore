A derangement is a permutation of a set without fixed points. The empty set can be considered a derangement of itself, because it has only one permutation ( {\displaystyle 0!=1} {\displaystyle 0!=1}), and it is vacuously true that no element (of the empty set) can be found that retains its original position.


The order of operations used throughout mathematics, science, technology and many computer programming languages is expressed here:[3]

exponents[1] and roots
multiplication[1] and division[1]
addition[1] and subtraction[1]
This means that if a mathematical expression is preceded by one binary operator and followed by another, the operator higher on the list should be applied first






In mathematics, a bijection, bijective function or one-to-one correspondence is a function between the elements of two sets, where each element of one set is paired with exactly one element of the other set, and each element of the other set is paired with exactly one element of the first set. There are no unpaired elements. In mathematical terms, a bijective function f: X → Y is a one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective) mapping of a set X to a set Y.

A bijection from the set X to the set Y has an inverse function from Y to X. If X and Y are finite sets, then the existence of a bijection means they have the same number of elements. For infinite sets the picture is more complicated, leading to the concept of cardinal number, a way to distinguish the various sizes of infinite sets.

A bijective function from a set to itself is also called a permutation.

Bijective functions are essential to many areas of mathematics including the definitions of isomorphism, homeomorphism, diffeomorphism, permutation group, and projective map.




In abstract algebra, a group isomorphism is a function between two groups that sets up a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the groups in a way that respects the given group operations. If there exists an isomorphism between two groups, then the groups are called isomorphic. From the standpoint of group theory, isomorphic groups have the same properties and need not be distinguished.









In mathematics, cardinal numbers, or cardinals for short, are a generalization of the natural numbers used to measure the cardinality (size) of sets. The cardinality of a finite set is a natural number: the number of elements in the set. The transfinite cardinal numbers describe the sizes of infinite sets.

Cardinality is defined in terms of bijective functions. Two sets have the same cardinality if, and only if, there is a one-to-one correspondence (bijection) between the elements of the two sets. In the case of finite sets, this agrees with the intuitive notion of size. In the case of infinite sets, the behavior is more complex. A fundamental theorem due to Georg Cantor shows that it is possible for infinite sets to have different cardinalities, and in particular the cardinality of the set of real numbers is greater than the cardinality of the set of natural numbers. It is also possible for a proper subset of an infinite set to have the same cardinality as the original set, something that cannot happen with proper subsets of finite sets.

There is a transfinite sequence of cardinal numbers:

{\displaystyle 0,1,2,3,\ldots ,n,\ldots ;\aleph _{0},\aleph _{1},\aleph _{2},\ldots ,\aleph _{\alpha },\ldots .\ } 0,1,2,3,\ldots ,n,\ldots ;\aleph _{0},\aleph _{1},\aleph _{2},\ldots ,\aleph _{\alpha },\ldots .\ 
This sequence starts with the natural numbers including zero (finite cardinals), which are followed by the aleph numbers (infinite cardinals of well-ordered sets). The aleph numbers are indexed by ordinal numbers. Under the assumption of the axiom of choice, this transfinite sequence includes every cardinal number. If one rejects that axiom, the situation is more complicated, with additional infinite cardinals that are not alephs.










For a pairing between X and Y (where Y need not be different from X) to be a bijection, four properties must hold:

each element of X must be paired with at least one element of Y,
no element of X may be paired with more than one element of Y,
each element of Y must be paired with at least one element of X, and
no element of Y may be paired with more than one element of X.










In ring theory, a branch of abstract algebra, an ideal is a special subset of a ring. Ideals generalize certain subsets of the integers, such as the even numbers or the multiples of 3. Addition and subtraction of even numbers preserves evenness, and multiplying an even number by any other integer results in another even number; these closure and absorption properties are the defining properties of an ideal. An ideal can be used to construct a quotient ring similarly to the way that, in group theory, a normal subgroup can be used to construct a quotient group.

Among the integers, the ideals correspond one-for-one with the non-negative integers: in this ring, every ideal is a principal ideal consisting of the multiples of a single non-negative number. However, in other rings, the ideals may be distinct from the ring elements, and certain properties of integers, when generalized to rings, attach more naturally to the ideals than to the elements of the ring. For instance, the prime ideals of a ring are analogous to prime numbers, and the Chinese remainder theorem can be generalized to ideals. There is a version of unique prime factorization for the ideals of a Dedekind domain (a type of ring important in number theory).








1. Causality: the probability of a measurement outcome
at a certain time does not depend on the
choice of measurements that will be performed
later.
2. Perfect distinguishability: if a state is not completely
mixed (i.e. if it cannot be obtained as a
mixture from any other state), then there exists at
least one state that can be perfectly distinguished
from it.
3. Ideal compression: every source of information can
be encoded in a suitable physical system in a lossless
and maximally efficient fashion. Here lossless
means that the information can be decoded without
errors and maximally efficient means that every
state of the encoding system represents a state in
the information source.
4. Local distinguishability: if two states of a composite
system are different, then we can distinguish
between them from the statistics of local measurements
on the component systems.
5. Pure conditioning: if a pure state of system AB
undergoes an atomic measurement on system A,
then each outcome of the measurement induces a
pure state on system B. (Here atomic measurement
means a measurement that cannot be obtained as
a coarse-graining of another measurement).

A stronger version of axiom 5, introduced in Ref. [20],
is the following:
5’ Atomicity of composition: the sequential composition
of two atomic operations is atomic. (Here
atomic transformation means a transformation
that cannot be obtained from coarse-graining).






One view that emerged around the turn of the 20th century with the work of Cantor is that all mathematical objects can be defined as sets. The set {0,1} is a relatively clear-cut example. On the face of it the group Z2 of integers mod 2 is also a set with two elements. However, it cannot simply be the set {0,1}, because this does not mention the additional structure imputed to Z2 by the operations of addition and negation mod 2: how are we to tell which of 0 or 1 is the additive identity, for example? To organize this group as a set it can first be coded as the quadruple ({0,1},+,−,0), which in turn can be coded using one of several conventions as a set representing that quadruple, which in turn entails encoding the operations + and − and the constant 0 as sets.

Sets may include ordered denotation of the particular identities and operations that apply to them, indicating a group, abelian group, ring, field, or other mathematical object. These types of mathematical objects are commonly studied in abstract algebra.




One set with operations[edit]
Simple structures: no binary operation:

Set: a degenerate algebraic structure S having no operations.
Pointed set: S has one or more distinguished elements, often 0, 1, or both.
Unary system: S and a single unary operation over S.
Pointed unary system: a unary system with S a pointed set.
Group-like structures: one binary operation. The binary operation can be indicated by any symbol, or with no symbol (juxtaposition) as is done for ordinary multiplication of real numbers.

Magma or groupoid: S and a single binary operation over S.
Semigroup: an associative magma.
Monoid: a semigroup with identity.
Group: a monoid with a unary operation (inverse), giving rise to inverse elements.
Abelian group: a group whose binary operation is commutative.
Semilattice: a semigroup whose operation is idempotent and commutative. The binary operation can be called either meet or join.
Quasigroup: a magma obeying the latin square property. A quasigroup may also be represented using three binary operations.[2]
Loop: a quasigroup with identity.
Ring-like structures or Ringoids: two binary operations, often called addition and multiplication, with multiplication distributing over addition.

Semiring: a ringoid such that S is a monoid under each operation. Addition is typically assumed to be commutative and associative, and the monoid product is assumed to distribute over the addition on both sides, and the additive identity satisfies 0 x = 0 for all x.
Near-ring: a semiring whose additive monoid is a (not necessarily abelian) group.
Ring: a semiring whose additive monoid is an abelian group.
Lie ring: a ringoid whose additive monoid is an abelian group, but whose multiplicative operation satisfies the Jacobi identity rather than associativity.
Boolean ring: a commutative ring with idempotent multiplication operation.
Field: a commutative ring which contains a multiplicative inverse for every nonzero element
Kleene algebras: a semiring with idempotent addition and a unary operation, the Kleene star, satisfying additional properties.
*-algebra: a ring with an additional unary operation (*) satisfying additional properties.
Lattice structures: two or more binary operations, including operations called meet and join, connected by the absorption law.[3]

Complete lattice: a lattice in which arbitrary meet and joins exist.
Bounded lattice: a lattice with a greatest element and least element.
Complemented lattice: a bounded lattice with a unary operation, complementation, denoted by postfix ⊥. The join of an element with its complement is the greatest element, and the meet of the two elements is the least element.
Modular lattice: a lattice whose elements satisfy the additional modular identity.
Distributive lattice: a lattice in which each of meet and join distributes over the other. Distributive lattices are modular, but the converse does not hold.
Boolean algebra: a complemented distributive lattice. Either of meet or join can be defined in terms of the other and complementation. This can be shown to be equivalent with the ring-like structure of the same name above.
Heyting algebra: a bounded distributive lattice with an added binary operation, relative pseudo-complement, denoted by infix →, and governed by the axioms x → x = 1, x (x → y) = x y, y (x → y) = y, x → (y z) = (x → y) (x → z).
Arithmetics: two binary operations, addition and multiplication. S is an infinite set. Arithmetics are pointed unary systems, whose unary operation is injective successor, and with distinguished element 0.

Robinson arithmetic. Addition and multiplication are recursively defined by means of successor. 0 is the identity element for addition, and annihilates multiplication. Robinson arithmetic is listed here even though it is a variety, because of its closeness to Peano arithmetic.
Peano arithmetic. Robinson arithmetic with an axiom schema of induction. Most ring and field axioms bearing on the properties of addition and multiplication are theorems of Peano arithmetic or of proper extensions thereof.
Two sets with operations[edit]
Module-like structures: composite systems involving two sets and employing at least two binary operations.

Group with operators: a group G with a set Ω and a binary operation Ω × G → G satisfying certain axioms.
Module: an abelian group M and a ring R acting as operators on M. The members of R are sometimes called scalars, and the binary operation of scalar multiplication is a function R × M → M, which satisfies several axioms. Counting the ring operations these systems have at least three operations.
Vector space: a module where the ring R is a division ring or field.
Graded vector space: a vector space with a direct sum decomposition breaking the space into "grades".
Quadratic space: a vector space V over a field F with a function from V into F satisfying certain properties. Every quadratic space is also an inner product space (see below).
Algebra-like structures: composite system defined over two sets, a ring R and a R module M equipped with an operation called multiplication. This can be viewed as a system with five binary operations: two operations on R, two on M and one involving both R and M.

Algebra over a ring (also R-algebra): a module over a commutative ring R, which also carries a multiplication operation that is compatible with the module structure. This includes distributivity over addition and linearity with respect to multiplication by elements of R. The theory of an algebra over a field is especially well developed.
Associative algebra: an algebra over a ring such that the multiplication is associative.
Nonassociative algebra: a module over a commutative ring, equipped with a ring multiplication operation that is not necessarily associative. Often associativity is replaced with a different identity, such as alternation, the Jacobi identity, or the Jordan identity.
Coalgebra: a vector space with a "comultiplication" defined dually to that of associative algebras.
Lie algebra: a special type of nonassociative algebra whose product satisfies the Jacobi identity.
Lie coalgebra: a vector space with a "comultiplication" defined dually to that of Lie algebras.
Graded algebra: a graded vector space with an algebra structure compatible with the grading. The idea is that if the grades of two elements a and b are known, then the grade of ab is known, and so the location of the product ab is determined in the decomposition.
Inner product space: an F vector space V with a sesquilinear binary operation V × V → F.
Four or more binary operations:

Bialgebra: an associative algebra with a compatible coalgebra structure.
Lie bialgebra: a Lie algebra with a compatible bialgebra structure.
Hopf algebra: a bialgebra with a connection axiom (antipode).
Clifford algebra: a graded associative algebra equipped with an exterior product from which may be derived several possible inner products. Exterior algebras and geometric algebras are special cases of this construction.
Hybrid structures[edit]
Algebraic structures can also coexist with added structure of non-algebraic nature, such as partial order or a topology. The added structure must be compatible, in some sense, with the algebraic structure.

Topological group: a group with a topology compatible with the group operation.
Lie group: a topological group with a compatible smooth manifold structure.
Ordered groups, ordered rings and ordered fields: each type of structure with a compatible partial order.
Archimedean group: a linearly ordered group for which the Archimedean property holds.
Topological vector space: a vector space whose M has a compatible topology.
Normed vector space: a vector space with a compatible norm. If such a space is complete (as a metric space) then it is called a Banach space.
Hilbert space: an inner product space over the real or complex numbers whose inner product gives rise to a Banach space structure.
Vertex operator algebra
Von Neumann algebra: a *-algebra of operators on a Hilbert space equipped with the weak operator topology.
